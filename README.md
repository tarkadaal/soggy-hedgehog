RAML to HTML converter written in Elixir

This isn't meant to be full featured. At time of writing, there isn't a HTML generator
that will work on RAML 1.0. I need something that will render my RAML 1.0 in a
more human readable format that raw RAML. I'm only using a subset of RAML 1.0,
so that's what I'm targeting.
